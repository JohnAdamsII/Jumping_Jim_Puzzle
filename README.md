# Jumping_Jim_Puzzle
This problem is based on the “Jumping Jim” maze problem (from “MAD MAZES: IntriguingMind Twisters for Puzzle Buffs, Game Nuts and Other Smart People” by Robert Abbott).  The text of the problem is quoted below.  A diagram of the maze is provided separately

Jumping Jim is about to begin his grand performance at the circus, but his jealous en-emy, Dastardly Dan, has restrung all the trampolines.  The number on each trampolineindicates how tightly strung each one is; in other words, the number indicates how farJim will have to move (horizontally or vertically, but NOT diagonally) when he bouncesoff the trampoline.  Jim begins his routine by leaping onto the trampoline at the upperleft.  He must get to the Goal at the lower right, where he will take his bow.  How canhe get there?The  diagram  shows  all  of  the  trampolines  with  each  represented  as  a  square.   Beginon the square at the upper left.  That square is marked 3.  From there you could, forexample, move three squares down to a square marked 2.  From there, you might movetwo squares right to a square marked 4, and from there you could move four squaresright to another square marked 2.  That path, incidentally, won’t get you to the goal.1
